DSA code of circular linked list
Circular Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which the first element points to the last element and the last element points to the first element. Both Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List can be made into a circular linked list.
Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:
Any node can be a starting point.
Useful for implementation of queue.
Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list.
Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap.
